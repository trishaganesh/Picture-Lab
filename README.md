# Picture-Lab
Creating and exploring different images

We analyze code and try to understand how we can create images. 
We also study code and modify it to print values within a given matrix.

Area for improvement: 
Initially, I struggled to understand how the PictureLab worked and how I could gain values from within a matrix. 
They were a bit difficult to understand at first. 

What I liked: 
I enjoyed working with images and trying to attain values from within a given matrix. I will be sure to revisit these concepts!
